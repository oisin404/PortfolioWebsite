    <p>
      I'm Oisín, a self-taught programmer and cybersecurity enthusiast based in England. My journey into technology began at a young age, and I've developed a passion for exploring various programming languages and frameworks. I have a diverse skill set that enables me to tackle a wide range of projects.

      My primary focus lies in web development, where I enjoy creating smooth and elegant user experiences. JavaScript is one of my favorite languages to work with, allowing me to build dynamic websites that engage users. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and continually strive to enhance my skills.
